# binara

## Installation

To install `binara` use

```shell
pip install binara
```

Although not required, as is generally good practice for any development project, we highly recommend creating a separate virtual environment for each distinct project. For example, via Conda, creating a virtual environment for a project using `binara` might look like

```
conda create -n binara_env python=3.11
```

Then before working, be sure to activate your environment with

```shell
conda activate binara_env
```

Then install `binara` within this environment.
